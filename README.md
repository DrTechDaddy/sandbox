# sandbox
a place to play and test stuff
I created this is the Mac App but maybe it didn't get pushed upstairs?

What;s wrong with tutoriaal>

1. they make you do git before github
2. they don't tell you the difference between working with the MAc app and working on the Githum website
3. They don't do things in an order that actually works
4. they assume you know too much about the GitHub software 
   but think you don't know enough about version control and programming
   
   Now how do I get this in my files and pushed up????
