a place to play and test stuff
I created this is the Mac App but maybe it didn't get pushed upstairs?

What's wrong with tutorials?

1. they make you do git before github
2. they don't tell you the difference between working with the Mac app and working on the GitHub website
3. they don't do things in an order that actually works
4. they assume you know too much about the GitHub software 
   but think you don't know enough about version control and programming

OK, so I have edited my readme.
   
   Now, how do I get this in my files and pushed up????
